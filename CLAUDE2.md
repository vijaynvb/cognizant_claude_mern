Generate a project: 

    1. backend
        1. nodejs with express js 
        2. use a inmemory database (e.g. an array or list) instead of db
        3. Define a simple "User" and "Todo" model as per open api specification
        4. Expose Rest API endpoints as per Open API Specification

    2. frontend 
        1. Build a React JS with React router
        2. create a simple UI to interact with the backend API
        3. use Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend 
        4. use basic bootstrap for styling the application 

    3. project structure:
        1. Organize the project in to seperate forlders for backend "server/" and frontend "client/" directories 
        2. use a monorepo structure to manage both parts of the application in a single repository
        3. include the pakage.json files in both server/ and client/ directories to manage the dependencies

    4. Add comment to explain each section of the code for better understanding 
    5. All variables should follow camelcase
